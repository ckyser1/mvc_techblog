# USER Story

AS a user I would like to use a site that allows me to find lost family members that I have been seperated from. 
    SO that I can find family members that I have lost, OR so that they can find me.

WHEN presented with a landing page:
    I can see a navagable list of posts that have recently been made.

THEN I am presented with an option to login or signup.

AFTER logging in:
    I am able to view a personal dashboard with links to my posts and a way to update my information.
    I am able to view and search for other people based off of a name. 
    I can make a new post that allows me to enter the following information.
        My name and information including:
            A short bio,
            Age,
            Current Location,
            Who I am trying to find,
            My current health status

I am able to delete my post and indicate that family members have been found. 

WHEN I view a post I am able to comment or reply to that post.
